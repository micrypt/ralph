# Ralph

Ralph is a Lisp-1 dialect that compiles to JavaScript. It is inspired by
[Dylan - An object-oriented dynamic language](http://lispm.dyndns.org/documentation/prefix-dylan/book.annotated/annotated-manual.html), but doesn't feature multiple-inheritance and multi-methods.

## Getting started

Install node, then:

* `$ ./scripts/build.sh`
* `$ ./scripts/test-build.sh`
